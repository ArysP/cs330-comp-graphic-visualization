### 1.	How do I approach designing software?
### o	What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
During my work on this project, I have developed several skills. These include how to create and render 2D and 3D shapes, how to apply color, textures and transformations to these shapes, and how to apply lighting to 3D objects.
### o	What design process did you follow for your project work?
Each week I would learn a new technique to apply to my 3D scene project. I then practiced on a separate sample of these concepts, before finally transforming and applying these techniques to the project itself. That was my process each week.
### o	How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
Coming into this class I had very little experience with most of the environment. Having the ability to research, practice, and apply newly acquired knowledge is a lifelong skill that can translate to any project, or even career.
### 2.	How do I approach developing programs?
### o	What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
I applied an iterative approach to developing the final project. As I mentioned before, each week something was added on top of the existing code. Going back and updating any outdated or inefficient code as I learned more.
### o	How did iteration factor into your development?
As I briefly mentioned above, iteration was an integral part of my project development. With each week a new concept was taught and with each week that same concept needed to be applied to the project. This meant many iterations of the same code. Improving the scale, updating deprecated code, and learning how to continuously integrate new lessons allowed me to create a sum greater than its parts.
### o	How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
I believe the iterative approach is simple in concept, but fittingly enough, can always be improved upon. By practicing an iterative approach, I have become more comfortable with it, and learned how to more quickly recognize how to iterate on my work. When and how to improve are things is a very subjective skill that I believe can only be learned through trial and error. 
### 3.	How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
### o	How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
While I am undecided on the specialization of computer science I would like to go into, the skills I learned in this class serves to bolster my technical literacy. By building a strong foundational knowledge of many different types of knowledge, like computation graphics, I allow myself more flexibility in the future when it comes to school.
### o	How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
Depending on the career I may choose to pursue, computational graphics can be very relevant. There is always a demand for skilled developers in todays job market and the skills I learn here can directly apply to many possible job opportunities in the future.
